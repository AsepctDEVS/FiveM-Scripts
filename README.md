Original Take Hostage Script Made By: rubbertoe98

Edited & Patched By: Vyast#0001

A few very exploitable server-sided events: 'TakeHostage:sync', 'TakeHostage:releaseHostage', 'TakeHostage:killHostage', which could be manipulated & used by modders in multiple ways to do different things such as take an entire server full of players hostage all at once, kill an entire server of players all at once, and more have been fully patched and protected by adding a distance check from the source player to the target player to further verify legitness.

Minor client sided optimizations & changes.

Instructions on how to use:
Type /takehostage, a valid weapon is needed(Add or remove weapons in client.lua)
Then press G to release the hostage or H to kill the hostage!
